/* ============================================================
 * Mock data. Pretend this is the JSON a real API would return.
 * Notice the deliberately awkward reality in here:
 *  - some items have no photos
 *  - some have no price (free)
 *  - some owners have no rating yet (null)
 *  - some items are "paused" and must not be bookable
 *  - distanceKm is null for some (viewer hasn't shared location)
 * Your UI has to handle ALL of these gracefully. That is the point.
 *
 * You may reshape how you load/serve this (a fake async fetch, a
 * context, a hook) — that architectural choice is yours to make
 * and to defend in your Decision Log.
